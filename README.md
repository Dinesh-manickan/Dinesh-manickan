## 💡 About Me

Hello! I'm Dinesh — a curious and enthusiastic tech lover who started exploring the world of websites during 11th grade. From YouTube tutorials to creating full-stack applications, my journey has been all about **learning by doing**.

I adore fixing real-world issues, streamlining workflows, and building responsive web applications with elegant UI/UX. Front-end wizardry with ReactJS, back-end operations with Node.js, or scripting with Python — I love testing my limits and building solutions that make a difference.
